			<p>Hello, my name is gautier, I am 21 and I am a student at <a href="https://www.ieseg.fr/" target="_blank">IESEG School Of Management</a>, this is my profile page.</p>

			<h2>My passion for music</h2>

			<p>I love music and I play <strong>guitar and keyboard</strong>. I have been playing music since I am 4, and it is my dream to quit studying to play music fulltime, however I still want to eat and have a roof over my head so I guess I'll keep studying to find job that is hopefully not too boring. (yeah the picture sucks but i did not have a better one :) )</p>

			<h2>My passion for computer sciences</h2>

			<p>I also love <strong>information sciences</strong>, and everything that relates to computers. I was quite a nerd when I was a kid. I used to make <strong>mods for my video games</strong> and learned 3D modeling and photoshop on my own to do that. I also like to develop systems, of any kind really, just systems that sort stuff automatically. However I really really suck in estetics as my color choice can suggest</p>

			<h2>Sorry for handing my profile page late</h2>

			<p>I am sorry to give my profile page only now I did not realize that the course did not extend to the whole semester. I am a chaotic person, organization in not my thing :)</p>

			<p><em>Also I would love putting links for my social media accounts but the truth is I try to be as distant as possible from social medias so I don't have instagram and such things so no links for me.</em></p>
